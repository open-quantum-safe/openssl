This experimental version of OpenSSL has been integrated with the Open Quantum Safe library,
including the new proposed signature API.

Setup
=====

Some manual setup is required to build and enable the Picnic signature scheme. The first
script downloads a fork of OQS enabling the Picnic signature algorithm, and sets it up.
The second script sets the required env variable to locate the Picnic paramaters. Both 
scripts must be run before building OpenSSL. Make sure the Picnic dependencies (libssl-dev,
libm4ri-dev) are installed:

sudo apt-get install libssl-dev libm4ri-dev
./get-and-setup-oqs-with-picnic.sh
source set-picnic-var.sh

Test
====

Run the following programs to test the PQC kex+auth TLS connection.

To generate a Picnic key (new app):
./apps/openssl genoqs -picnic -out picnic.key

To generate a Picnic cert:
./apps/openssl req -new -x509 -days 365 -sha256 -key picnic.key -out picnic.crt -subj "/C=US/L=Redmond/CN=OQStest" -config openssl.cnf

To test a complete (kex+auth) PQS TLS connection, start a server:
./apps/openssl s_server -cipher RLWEMSRLN16-PICNIC-AES256-GCM-SHA384 -cert picnic.crt -key picnic.key -www

And connect to it with a client
./apps/openssl s_client -cipher RLWEMSRLN16-PICNIC-AES256-GCM-SHA384 -connect localhost:4433

The following cipher suites are supported:
 * LWEFRODO-PICNIC-AES256-GCM-SHA384
 * RLWEMSRLN16-PICNIC-AES256-GCM-SHA384
 * SIDHCLN16-PICNIC-AES256-GCM-SHA384
